# Navigation links for the yellow banner (v. short names are a good idea)

# Note: the links need to work within the 'jupyter notebook' filesystem which
#       is a little different from the arrangements of the files on disk
#       /files/X.yyy points to _site/X.yyy
#       /notebooks/NBk/X.ipynb points to _site/NBk/X.ipynb but assumes the file is a runnable notebook
#       /edit/dir/X.yyy brings up the file _site/dir/X.yyy in the text editor
